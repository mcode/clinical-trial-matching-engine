    "description": "\n      This research study is studying an investigational drug as a possible treatment for breast\n      cancer that is positive for the protein Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2, also known\n      as HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\n      The drug involved in this study is:\n\n      -ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)\n    ",
    "detailedDescription": "\n      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety\n      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a\n      specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied and research doctors\n      are trying to find out more about it—such as the safest dose to use and the side effects it\n      may cause.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to examine the long-term benefits of T-DM1 with regard\n      to breast cancer and take a closer look at the side effects experienced by participants\n      receiving T-DM1.\n\n      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved T-DM1 for use in patients\n      with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, but it has been approved for use in advanced,\n      previously treated, HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\n      T-DM1 is an antibody-drug conjugate; it is made up of an antibody (trastuzumab) linked to a\n      cytotoxic drug, DM1 (chemotherapy). T-DM1 functions as a targeted cancer therapy because it\n      targets HER2-positive breast cancer cells directly, limiting exposure of the rest of the body\n      to chemotherapy. More specifically, the trastuzumab in T-DM1 first binds to the HER2 protein\n      on the surface of the breast cancer cells and the DM1 then enters the cells and can cause\n      them to die, preventing tumor growth\n    ",
    "criteria": "\n        Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2-positive disease\n             by local pathology, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or amplification by FISH\n             (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2 or an average of ≥6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus) AND confirmed\n             by Central Pathology Review (Dr. Deborah Dillon at Brigham and Women's Hospital,\n             Boston, MA) prior to patient being registered to begin protocol therapy. See section\n             3.4. http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2013.50.9984\n\n          -  NOTE: DCIS components should not be counted in the determination of HER2 status.\n\n          -  Age ≥60 years at the time of study registration (men and women eligible)\n\n          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage I-III breast\n             cancer with the following criteria met:\n\n          -  If node-negative or if node status unknown (because it was not assessed), tumor must\n             be \u003e5 mm (T1b per AJCC 7th edition) of any hormone receptor subtype (document ER/PR\n             status: if some ER/PR staining is present, ER and PR negative are defined as being\n             positive in \u003c10% cells [per local pathology read]).\n\n          -  If node-positive (N1-N3), T1mi, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, or T3 tumors are eligible (see\n             below for further details on defining node-negative disease) Definition of\n             node-negative disease (when node status known): If the patient has had a negative\n             sentinel node biopsy and/or a negative axillary dissection, then the patient is\n             determined to be node-negative. Axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters ≤\n             0.2 mm by either H\u0026E or IHC will be considered node-negative. Any axillary lymph node\n             with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2cm is considered a micrometastasis. Patients\n             with a micrometastasis are eligible even if their tumor is \u003c/= 5mm. An axillary\n             dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a positive sentinel node\n             and management of the axilla will be left up to the treating provider. In cases where\n             the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation,\n             the principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility. In\n             these special situations, the investigator must document this approval in the patient\n             medical record.\n\n          -  ER/PR determination assays performed by IHC methods according to the local institution\n             standard protocol.\n\n          -  Standard chemotherapy/trastuzumab declined by patient OR patient is deemed by\n             physician for any reason to not be a candidate for standard therapy (i.e. patient\n             and/or provider choose not to pursue standard trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen\n             because of concerns related to toxicity or provider/patient preference).\n\n          -  For patients with bilateral or multifocal/multicentric breast cancers, one of the\n             following criteria must be met to enroll: (1) each cancer individually meets criteria\n             for enrollment (only ONE tumor has to undergo central confirmation for HER2), OR (2)\n             at least one tumor meets eligibility (per tumor size/nodes/subtype outlined above) and\n             the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are also HER2-positive but\n             are too small for enrollment (e.g., a patient is eligible if a cancer is T2N0 and\n             HER2-positive in one breast, but the contralateral breast has a T1a HER2+ cancer that\n             isn't eligible on its own, OR, (3) at least one tumor meets eligibility and the other\n             foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are HER2-negative and do not meet\n             criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy per provider discretion (e.g. if a patient has a\n             HER2-positive tumor meeting eligibility but also has a second, HER2-negative, small,\n             node-negative, ER+, low grade cancer present, she is still eligible for enrollment).\n             However, in the specific case that a second breast cancer is stage III and\n             HER2-negative, that patient is excluded (because the second cancer is high-risk and\n             likely will require non-HER2-directed therapy).\n\n          -  All tumor removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy\n             (lumpectomy).\n\n          -  NOTE: Management of axillary lymph nodes is up to the treating provider; however, all\n             surgical margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e., no tumor on ink).\n             The local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology\n             report. If all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is\n             permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the\n             pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed. Likewise, if all other margins are\n             clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided\n             the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed.\n\n             -≤90 days from the patient's most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer.\n\n          -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-2.

Pre-menopausal women need to use\n             birth control while on this study and women should not breastfeed a baby while on this\n             study. Any man treated on this study will also need to use contraception if his\n             partner is a premenopausal female.

Any staging scans will be\n             ordered at the treating provider's discretion. If metastatic disease is found on any\n             staging studies done, patients will not be eligible for enrollment.\n\n          -  Locally advanced tumors at diagnosis (T4), including tumors fixed to the chest wall,\n             peau d'orange, skin ulcerations/nodules, or clinical inflammatory changes (diffuse\n             brawny cutaneous induration with an erysipeloid).\n\n          -  Patients with stage III, HER2-negative cancer in the contralateral breast (see 3.1.6\n             above).\n\n          -  Positive Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody) and/or Hepatitis C\n             (Hepatitis C antibody test) as indicated by serologies conducted ≤3 months prior to\n             registration if liver function tests are outside of the normal institutional range.\n\n          -  NOTE: Patients with positive Hepatitis B or C serologies indicating active infection\n             without known active disease must meet the eligibility requirements for ALT, AST,\n             total bilirubin, INR, PTT, and alkaline phosphatase on at least two consecutive\n             occasions, separated by at least 1 week.
